# How to Upgrade a Basic Reverse Shell to a Fully Interactive Ubuntu Shell

When you gain access to a target machine via a reverse shell, the default shell environment is often limited: no terminal features, no command history, no job control, and programs like `clear` or `vim` may misbehave.

This guide explains how to upgrade a basic reverse shell session into a fully interactive Ubuntu shell **after gaining access** â€” without modifying the original reverse shell code.

## Why Upgrade the Shell?

- **Proper terminal behavior:** Supports Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, arrow keys, tab completion, etc.
- **Full environment:** Loads user profiles and environment variables like a normal login shell.
- **Better usability:** Supports advanced shell features, color prompts, aliases, and job control.
- **Smooth program operation:** Programs like `clear`, `nano`, `vim`, and `top` work correctly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Allocate a Pseudo-Terminal (PTY)

A PTY is necessary for interactive shell features.

Run this command inside your current shell session to spawn a bash shell with a PTY:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
