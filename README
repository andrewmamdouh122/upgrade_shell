# Upgrading a Basic Reverse Shell to a Fully Interactive Ubuntu Shell

After successfully gaining access to a target machine via a reverse shell, the shell environment is often limited and lacks interactivity and familiar terminal behavior.  
Follow these steps **after connecting** to upgrade your shell session to behave like a native Ubuntu terminal.

## Full Upgrade Command Block

Run all of the following commands together to upgrade your shell:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' || python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm-256color
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export HOME=/home/$(whoami)
export USER=$(whoami)
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
bash --login -i
reset
