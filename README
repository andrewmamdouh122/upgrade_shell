# Upgrading a Basic Reverse Shell to a Fully Interactive Ubuntu Shell

After successfully gaining access to a target machine via a reverse shell, the shell environment is often limited and lacks interactivity and familiar terminal behavior.  
Follow these steps **after connecting** to upgrade your shell session to behave like a native Ubuntu terminal.

---

## 1. Allocate a Proper Pseudo-Terminal (PTY)

Run this command to spawn a fully interactive bash shell with a PTY:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

If Python 3 is unavailable, try:

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
2. Set Essential Environment Variables

Export important environment variables to enable terminal features and proper shell behavior:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export HOME=/home/$(whoami)
export USER=$(whoami)
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```
3. Start Bash as a Login Interactive Shell

Run bash with login and interactive flags to source user profile scripts and initialize the environment correctly:

```bash
bash --login -i
```
